Kelsey's Dot Files
==================

These are my personal configuration files.

_... vim, zsh, font rendering etc. ..._



Gnome-Terminal Colours
----------------------

These are the RGB values for gnome-terminal colours that should be used with my zsh configuration:

_... source: [stevelosh.com](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2009/03/candy-colored-terminal/) ..._

    Black:     000-000-000
    Red:       229-034-034
    Green:     166-227-045
    Yellow:    252-149-030
    Blue:      196-141-255
    Magenta:   250-037-115
    Cyan:      103-217-240
    White:     242-242-242

I also like to disable "Allow bold text" and set scheme to "Gray on black".



Notes
-----

Be careful of using the install script. It will overwrite all your old dotfiles without asking! The script copies everything including the install script and readme. This is for ease of future pushes to github.
