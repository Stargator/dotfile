Kelsey's Dotfiles
=================

These are my personal configuration files.

_... vim, zsh, font rendering etc. ..._


Vim
---

Consider the following plugins - NERDTree, Conque (terminal emulator inside vim - eg. `:ConqueTerm zsh` will open zsh in the current vim window).


Notes
-----

The install script now dynamically generates dotfiles based on your central configuration file (~/.dotfiles.conf.yml). If this file doesn't already exist it will be created with defaults.

Be careful when using the install script. It will overwrite all of your old dotfiles without prompting!
