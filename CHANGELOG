	* The local configuration file can now be stored in the local configuration directory alongside dotfile.conf as dotfile.conf.local. If ~/.dotfile.conf.local exists, it will take priority.

20121224 - 0.2.2
  * Add new template syntax {{exec:method_name,arg1,arg2}}. Methods are defined in <dotfile_directory>/exec.rb.
  * Scripts set with the executable permission bit will now execute regardless of their interpreter, and regardless of file extension (assuming a valid shebang). Non-executable files will still execute assuming they have an accepted file extension. Currently accepted extensions are now .rb, .py, .pl and .sh. If the script is non-executable AND has no extension, a warning will be given and the script will be ignored.
  * Refactored Dotfile::CLI into separate modules for the sake of organization.
  * Fixed a very minor bug with attempting to edit a dotfile when no configuration (groups.conf specifically) exists.

20121022 - 0.2.1
  * Worked on adding basic documentation to the public interfaces of each class.

20121018 - 0.2.0
  * Added new command line option "--set OPTION:VALUE". Temporarily set an option to another value for only the current update (for testing or whatever). Also accepts a comma delimited list of OPTION:VALUE pairs. Should always be used with an update option, or it won't do anything!
  * Comply (a little loosely) with the XDG Base Directory Specification. Dotfiles directory will now default to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/dotfile, falling back to ~/.config/dotfile and finally ~/.dotfile (the previous default).
  * Fixed a bug where template files would not be parsed if found recursively under a directory (not specified explicitly) in groups.conf.

20120924 - 0.1.9
  * Old theme functionality is broken. I felt there was no choice but to remove it in favour of a more flexible alternative. The old method (matching against .*_theme$) meant that no option could end in "_theme". This obviously caused issues when I tried to set "gtk3_theme: Adwaita". This is just a result of poor planning. The new method is to specify a file (rather than "theme") in a template as "{{file:the_option}}", then simply use "the_option:" in dotfile.conf. The files matched will be searched for under ~.dotfile/files (or Dotfile::FILES).
