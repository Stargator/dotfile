Kelsey's Dot Files
==================

These are my personal configuration files.

Setup with: `git clone git://github.com/kelseyjudson/dotfiles.git ~/`

_... be sure to backup anything that may be affected before cloning ..._

Notes
-----

The VIM configuration requires that the directory ~/.vim\_backup exists and that the Molokai theme is installed.
